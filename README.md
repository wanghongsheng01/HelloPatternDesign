Head First Design Patterns (2020 2nd Edition)

I have recently updated all the codes for Head First Design Patterns for the 2nd edition of the book, released in May, 2021.

Download the code and compile and run from the command line, or load the code into project in Xcode using C++11 or higher.

Here are the command instructions for compiling and running this project from the command line:
* `compiling all the CPP files and then generating the executable main file`
###
    g++ test.cpp -std=c++14 -Wall -o main
 
* `running the  main file`
###
    ./main
