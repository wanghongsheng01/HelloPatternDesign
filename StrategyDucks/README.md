# The Strategy Pattern 
* defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently<br>
from clients that use it.

* “We’re using the strategy pattern to implement the various behaviors of our ducks.” This tells you the duck behavior has been encapsulated<br>
into its own set of classes that can be easily expanded and changed, even at runtime if needed.
